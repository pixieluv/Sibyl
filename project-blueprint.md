# **Project Blueprint: The FinOps Command Center**

## **1\. The Core Problem ("The Chaos")**

In hyper-growth environments (like Twitch, DoorDash), the "cost of doing business" is chaotic.

* **Data is Siloed:** Metrics live in `Graphite`, cloud costs live in `CloudWatch`, and business logic lives in `SQL`.  
* **Attribution is Manual:** `Tagging` is a "best effort" that often fails, making it impossible to connect a $1M cost spike to a specific team.  
* **Compliance is Manual:** There is no system to proactively find or enforce tagging standards, leading to "shadow IT" and untracked costs.  
* **Performance is Unknown:** It's impossible to know the *true* capacity or cost of a "single unit" (one API call, one new instance) without a complex, isolated engineering effort.  
* **Forecasting is Guesswork:** Teams rely on "rules of thumb" instead of statistical models, leading to massive over-provisioning (waste) or under-provisioning (outages).  
* **Budgets are Disconnected:** The Engineering forecast and the Finance budget are two different spreadsheets that never match, leading to end-of-quarter "surprises."  
* **Action is Disconnected:** When a service *does* hit 90% capacity, the on-call engineer has to manually find the right `playbook`.  
* **Planning is Static:** Capacity plans are built in spreadsheets, disconnected from live data, and instantly out of date.

  ## **2\. The Solution ("The Order")**

A single, unified platform that **connects technical metrics, business metrics, attribution, compliance, performance testing, predictive forecasting, budget reconciliation, actionable playbooks, and automated governance.**

## **3\. Core Pillars (The Framework)**

Here is a breakdown of the tool, built from your core requirements:

### **Pillar 1: The "Universal Connector" (Data Ingestion)**

The foundation of the tool. This module's only job is to connect to and normalize data from every source.

* **Metric Connectors:** Pluggable adapters for `Graphite`, `Ganglia`, `Prometheus`, `Datadog`, etc.  
* **Cloud Connectors:** API-driven integration with `AWS CloudWatch`, `GCP Monitoring`, and `Azure Monitor`.  
* **Cost Connectors:** Ingestion of the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) and equivalent billing data.  
* **Business Metric Connectors:** Pluggable adapters for business-level data sources (e.g., SQL-based data warehouses like `Snowflake`/`BigQuery`, `Salesforce`, or internal 'user growth' APIs).  
* **Financial Planning Connectors:** Pluggable adapters for financial planning tools (`Anaplan`, `Workday`, or G-Sheet/CSV) to ingest the "Finance Plan of Record" (the official budget).

  ### **Pillar 2: The "Attribution Engine" (The Hierarchy)**

This is the "brain" that answers the question, "Who does this belong to?" It connects the technical asset (the server) to the business owner (the team).

* **Business Hierarchy Model:** A flexible model to import and map the organizational structure (`Business Group` \> `Business Unit` \> `Team`).  
* **Tagging Integration:** A powerful rules-engine that enriches all incoming metrics with attribution data. It normalizes messy tags (e.g., "team\_foo" and "foo-team" become "Team: Foo").  
* **Service Catalog:** A central registry that defines what a "service" is and which teams own its components.

  ### **Pillar 3: The "Tagging Compliance Engine" (The Enforcer)**

This is the new proactive "enforcer" that audits reality against the rules defined in Pillar 2\. This is the feature that *enables* FinOps.

* **Tagging Compliance Scorecard:** A dashboard that shows the % of tagged vs. untagged resources, viewable by `Business Unit` or `Team`.  
* **Untagged Resource Finder:** A proactive engine that constantly scans cloud provider APIs (e.g., AWS Config) to find and list all orphan or untagged resources.  
* **"Showback" Incentives:** Automatically allocates the *cost* of all untagged resources to a central "Unattributable" bucket, creating a powerful financial incentive for VPs to enforce compliance on their teams.

  ### **Pillar 4: "The Proving Ground" (Unit & Performance Testing)**

This is the "engineering lab" that establishes the *ground truth* for unit cost and performance. It answers the question, "How many 'units' can this one 'thing' handle?"

* **Load Test Integration:** Pluggable adapters for common load-testing frameworks (`JMeter`, `Locust`, `k6`, `vegeta`).  
* **Unit Definition:** A simple UI for defining a "unit" to be tested (e.g., "1 API call," "1 active user," "1 order transaction").  
* **Controlled Environment Testing:** A workflow to spin up an isolated test environment (e.g., a single `m7g.large` instance), run a load test, and capture the performance data (CPU, RAM, I/O) and cost.  
* **Unit Cost Baseline:** The output of this pillar is the "ground truth" data. It feeds the `Sibyl` and the `Cockpit`, establishing the baseline "cost-per-unit" that makes accurate forecasting possible.

  ### **Pillar 5: The "Sibyl" (Forecasting & Modeling)**

This is the "Sibyl" \- the "magic" that provides the forward-looking view. It uses the ground truth from Pillar 4 to move the company from *reactive* to *proactive*.

* **Statistical Engine:** Uses **`R` (or Python with Prophet/Statsmodels)** to run advanced forecasting models (like ARIMA or Holt-Winters) on the normalized data.  
* **"What-If" Scenario Engine:** A UI for leadership to model scenarios. Allows a user to ask, "What is the 12-month cost impact if we **double new user signups**?" or "What are the **predicted savings** if we migrate the 'Video' service to Graviton instances?"  
* **Trend Visualization:** The UI for this module. It plots historical and *forecasted* usage over all your time windows: `1 month`, `3 months`, `6 months`, `1 year`, `2 years`, `5 years`.  
* **Event-Based Modeling:** The user can "teach" the Sibyl about upcoming events (like Prime Day) to model how "spiky" traffic will impact the forecast.

  ### **Pillar 6: The "Cockpit" (The Unified Dashboard)**

This is the user-facing "single pane of glass" where all the data comes together.

* **Budget vs. Forecast vs. Actuals:** The "CFO Dashboard." A single-view chart showing:  
  1. The `Official Budget` (from Pillar 1\)  
  2. The `Actual Spend` to date (from Pillar 1\)  
  3. The `Sibyl's Forecast` for the rest of the year (from Pillar 5\)  
* **Hierarchical Roll-ups:** A VP can see the 1-year cost and usage forecast for their entire `Business Group`, **complete with MoM and YoY trend analysis.**  
* **Unit Economics Dashboard:** Leverages data from all pillars to automatically calculate and trend key unit economic costs, such as "Cost per Active User" or "Cost per Order."  
* **Optimization & Savings Engine:** A proactive module that automatically scans for cost-saving opportunities (e.g., "This service is 40% over-provisioned," "Migrate these 10 instances to Graviton," "This RI is under-utilized"). Each recommendation is bundled with **predicted monthly/annual savings** to create an immediate business case.

  ### **Pillar 7: "The Playbook" (Action & Triage)**

This is the **"special sauce"** that connects the *insight* from the Sibyl directly to the *operational response*.

* **Playbook Repository:** Integrates with Confluence, Notion, or a local Markdown repo to store each `team's playbook`.  
* **Alert-to-Playbook:** When the "Sibyl" (Pillar 5\) forecasts that a service will breach its 90% capacity threshold *in 30 days*, it sends an alert with a **direct link to that service's "Scale-Up Playbook."**  
* **Accountability:** It tracks *who* received the alert and whether the playbook was actioned, creating a feedback loop for leadership.

  ### **Pillar 8: "The Architect" (Capacity Plan Generation)**

This is the "order from chaos" feature. It takes the data from all other pillars and automatically generates the formal, shareable capacity plan.

* **Capacity Plan Templates:** A repository of pre-built `Markdown` or `Notion` templates for different types of capacity requests.  
* **Automated Plan Generation:** A user can "one-click" generate a new capacity plan. The tool pre-populates the template with:  
  * **Owner:** The `Team` from Pillar 2\.  
  * **Baseline:** The "cost-per-unit" data from `The Proving Ground` (Pillar 4).  
  * **Forecast:** The `Sibyl` (Pillar 5\) 12-month forecast graphs, including "What-If" scenarios.  
  * **Business Justification:** The `Business Metric` overlay and **MoM/YoY growth trends** from Pillar 6\.  
  * **Cost Model & Budget:** The projected cost vs. the *actual* budget (from Pillar 6).  
  * **Optimization Opportunities:** A summary of **predicted savings** (from Pillar 6).  
* **Version Control & Workflow:** The generated plan can be version-controlled (via Git) and routed for approval to leadership, creating a formal, auditable trail.

  ### **Pillar 9: "The Governance Gantry" (The Gatekeeper)**

This is the final "Act I" rigor that gives the platform *teeth*. It connects the *plan* (Pillar 8\) to the *action* (deployment).

* **Provisioning Tool Integration:** Pluggable adapters for `Terraform`, `CloudFormation`, and internal deployment systems.  
* **Deployment Gating:** Acts as a formal gate. A new service or scaling action cannot be deployed unless:  
  1. It has an **"Approved" Plan ID** from Pillar 8\.  
  2. All new resources in the deploy **pass the tagging compliance rules** defined in Pillar 3\.  
* **Automated Feedback Loop:** If a deploy fails the gate, it fails the build with a clear error: "Deploy failed: No approved capacity plan found. Please generate a new plan here: \[link to Pillar 8\]."

### **MVP Scope: The "Visibility Engine"**

1. **Pillar 1 (Ingestion \- Minimal):**  
   * Focus solely on **one** primary cost source: **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**. This is usually the biggest spend and the most complex data.  
   * Connect to **one** primary metric source: **AWS CloudWatch**. (We can add Graphite/Datadog later).  
   * *Defer* Business Metrics and Financial Planning connectors for now.  
2. **Pillar 2 (Attribution \- Core):**  
   * Build the **Business Hierarchy Model** (Team \> BU \> BG). This can start simple (even a config file or basic database table).  
   * Build the **Tagging Integration rules engine**. This is essential for enrichment.  
   * Build the basic **Service Catalog**.  
3. **Pillar 3 (Compliance \- Finder Only):**  
   * Build the **Untagged Resource Finder**. This provides immediate value by identifying cost leakage.  
   * *Defer* the Scorecard and Showback Incentives for now.  
4. **Pillar 6 (Cockpit \- Basic Dashboard):**  
   * Build **one simple dashboard:** "Cost by Team (Last 30 Days)". This dashboard will display data pulled and processed through Pillars 1, 2, and 3\.  
   * Include MoM trend analysis for this view.  
   * *Defer* the complex forecasting, unit economics, budget reconciliation, and optimization engines for later versions.

### **Actionable First Steps:**

* **Choose Your Tech Stack:** What languages/frameworks feel right?  
  * **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)? Node.js? Go? (Python is often strong for data processing).  
  * **Frontend:** React? Vue? Angular? (Or maybe just simple server-side rendering initially?)  
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL? MySQL? (Postgres is often favored for analytical queries).  
  * **Data Processing:** Will you use Pandas/Dask (Python), or rely on database queries?  
* **Schema Design:** Let's map out the basic database tables for:  
  * `Teams`, `BusinessUnits`, `BusinessGroups`  
  * `Services` (linking to Teams)  
  * `CloudResources` (linking to Services, capturing tags)  
  * `CostData` (storing processed CUR data, linked to Resources/Teams)  
  * `MetricData` (storing CloudWatch data, linked to Resources/Teams)  
* **Build Pillar 1 \- CUR Ingestion:** This is often the most challenging part. Start by writing the code to:  
  * Connect to S3 where the CUR files are stored.  
  * Parse the CUR files (they are large CSVs, often Parquet).  
  * Load the relevant cost data into your `CostData` table.  
* **Build Pillar 2 \- Tag Enrichment:** Write the logic to:  
  * Read the tags from the `CloudResources` table (or directly from the CUR).  
  * Apply your normalization rules.  
  * Update the `CostData` table with the correct `TeamID`.  
* **Build Pillar 3 \- Untagged Finder:** Write the code to:  
  * Query the `CostData` table for entries where `TeamID` is null or "Unattributable."  
  * Potentially query AWS APIs (like Config or Resource Groups Tagging API) to find resources missing required tags.  
* **Build Pillar 6 \- Basic Dashboard:** Create the first simple web page or API endpoint that queries the `CostData` table, groups by `TeamID`, sums the cost for the last 30 days, calculates the MoM change, and displays it.
